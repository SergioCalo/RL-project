# TRPO implementation in a Mujoco environment
Reinforcement learning course final project:
Project done together with my partner Aaron Verdaguer for the Reinforcement Learning course with Professor Gergely Neu, for the Master in Interactive Intelligent Systems, UPF. In this project, we developed an implementation of the TRPO algorithm based on the work of the user ikostrikov: https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-trpo

A web application is also developed for direct communication between the user and the algorithm. All details in the PDF of the report.
